AP Capstone Project Proposal

1. Project Title
QuickNotes - A Personal Note-Taking Web App

2. Problem Statement
Students and professionals often need a simple, distraction-free way to store and access notes from anywhere. Many existing apps are bloated with unnecessary features or require paid plans.
QuickNotes aims to provide a clean, secure, and minimal note-taking platform.

Crucially, to handle the inevitable growth in user notes, the platform will include support for searching, filtering, sorting, and pagination to ensure fast load times and an excellent, scalable user experience.
This allows users to quickly create, edit, access, and manage their notes online.

3. System Architecture (Updated)

Stack Overview:

Frontend: React.js with React Router for page navigation

Backend: Node.js + Express (API)

Database: PostgreSQL (relational database)

Authentication: JWT-based login/signup
